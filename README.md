# HashMap

## ABOUT

> *An excercise on how to create a **Hash Map**, initialising it as a class in which we can instantiate a HashMap object. The HashMap contains a multitude of desired functions listed below. As an added bonus, a **Hash Set** has also been created*

## What is a HashMap?

*A **hash map** takes in a key value pair, produces a hash code (a numerical index), and stores the pair in a bucket. As the Hash Map grows, we need to keep track of two factors:

- **Capacity** => the total number of buckets
- **Load Factor** => number between 0.75 and 1 designated as threshold to grow our bucket size.

A **Hash Set** achieves the same objectives, however it stores *only key values*.

## FUNCTIONS

1. `hash(key)` takes a key and produces a hash code with it
2. `set(key, value)` takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten.
3. `get(key)` takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null
4. `has(key)` takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
5. `remove(key)` takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false
6. `length()` returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
7. `clear()` removes all entries in the hash map.
8. `keys()` returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
9. `values()` returns an array containing all the values.
10. `entries()` returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]
